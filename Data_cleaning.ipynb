    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using models to score the **quality of pretraining data** has become a standard method for data cleaning. Technologies behind models like **llama3** and **qwen2** have all mentioned this. In this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BERT-based models** are especially suitable because they are **encoder-based (transformer) models** that are good at representing text.\n",
    "* These BERT-type models can be used to **score the quality of data**, or we can even use **stronger instruction-tuned models** like GPT-4o to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to train a classifier that distinguishes between **high-quality** and **low-quality** training data. Here’s how:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **manually select a set of high-quality samples** and **low-quality samples** as labeled data.\n",
    "* These labeled samples are used to train a model (like BERT) to **predict the quality** of other unlabelled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a scoring model is not about reaching 100% accuracy — the goal is **practical separation**. Even if the classifier is not perfect, as long as it separates high and low-quality data reasonably well, it’s useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even if your scoring model isn’t super strong, it’s better to have one than none.\n",
    "* For example, if you spend a month training a scoring model, it could be more effective than manually cleaning 32K samples.\n",
    "* Suppose you have 32K total samples — 4K low quality and 28K high quality. You can use the model to filter or re-rank the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bert-base** or **FastText** are commonly used for this task.\n",
    "* You just need to fine-tune them slightly.\n",
    "* You can refer to Deepseek-Math’s [8.1 Technical Report](https://example.com) (placeholder for the link) for more details.\n",

    "     * **Cross-document deduplication** (e.g., same content appearing in different files).\n",
    "     * **Model-based deduplication** where similar outputs across different model checkpoints are filtered (e.g., LLaMA filtered both raw CommonCrawl and C4 data to avoid overlap).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deduplication Based on Training Frequency**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If a sample appears multiple times during training (multiple **epochs**), deduplication should be handled depending on data type and source.\n",
    "   * Some datasets are trained with different epochs, and deduplication strategies should account for that.\n",
    "\n",
